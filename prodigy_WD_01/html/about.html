            <h1>About Fyodor Dostoevsky <span class="emoji">✍️</span></h1>
            <p>
                Meet Fyodor Dostoevsky, one of the greatest literary geniuses of all time! Born in 1821 in Moscow, this Russian novelist 
                wasn’t just a writer—he was a philosopher, a psychologist, and a guy who truly understood the complexities of human nature.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dostoevsky's life was no less dramatic than his novels. Picture this: A young man studying engineering, dabbling in radical 
                ideas, and ending up arrested and sentenced to death. Yeah, that’s right—he was <i>almost</i> executed. At the last moment, 
                his sentence was commuted to hard labor in Siberia. Talk about life-changing experiences!

            <h2>The Birth of "Notes from the Underground" 🕳️</h2>
            <p>
                After years of hardship and introspection, Dostoevsky wrote "Notes from the Underground" in 1864. It’s considered one of 
                the first existentialist novels ever written. Think of it as the book that paved the way for modern philosophical fiction. 
                It’s dark, satirical, and absolutely brilliant.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The protagonist, the Underground Man, isn’t your typical hero. He’s bitter, sarcastic, and full of contradictions—a perfect 
                representation of Dostoevsky’s exploration of human psychology. This book isn’t just a story; it’s a window into the 
                deepest corners of the human soul.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dostoevsky’s works are timeless because they deal with questions we all face: What does it mean to be free? Why do we make 
                irrational choices? Can we ever escape our own minds? Reading "Notes from the Underground" isn’t just an experience—it’s 
                a challenge to think deeper and live better.
            </p>
